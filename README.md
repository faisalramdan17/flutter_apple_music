### [iTunes Search API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api)

#### Overview

The Search API allows you to place search fields in your website to search for content within the iTunes Store and Apple Books Store. You can search for a variety of content; including books, movies, podcasts, music, music videos, audiobooks, and TV shows. You can also call an ID-based lookup request to create mappings between your content library and the digital catalog. Developers may use promotional content in the API, including previews of songs, music videos, album art and App icons only to promote store content and not for entertainment purposes. Use of sound samples and other assets from the API must be proximate to a store badge. Terms and conditions apply.

The Partners Program allows you to earn a commission on qualifying revenue generated by clicks initiated from your website or app into the iTunes Store and Apple Books Store. For more information on the Partners Program, see http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates.

#### Searching

To search for content from a field in your website and display the results in your website, you must create a search field that passes a fully-qualified URL content request to the iTunes Store, parse the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format returned from the search, and display the results in your website, 
see : https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api.

## File & Folder Structure

5) **shared**: Contains configuration with constants, utilities, extentions, theme style, popup dialogs, and global widgets for the Flutter project.

## Instructions to Build and Deploy The App

### Set Up & Running

#### 1. Clone The Github Repo

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/faisalramdan17/kuncie_music.git
$ cd kuncie_music
```

#### 2. Get Packages

```bash
flutter pub get
```

#### 3. Running The App

```bash
flutter run
```

#### 4. Automated Unit Testing

```bash
flutter test
```

### Build and Deploy the App

During a typical development cycle, you test an app using `flutter run` at the command line, or by using the **Run** and **Debug** options in your IDE. By default, Flutter builds a debug version of your app.

When you’re ready to deploy or prepare a release version of your app, this Instructions can help:

#### [Android App](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android)

**Note**: For the complete guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of build APK and releasing a Flutter app to the Play Store, For more details, see https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android.

##### Build an APK

From the command line:

1) Enter `cd [project]`
2) Run `flutter build apk --split-per-abi`. (The `flutter build` command defaults to `--release`.)

This command results in three APK files:

* `[project]/build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk`
* `[project]/build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-arm64-v8a-release.apk`
* `[project]/build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-x86_64-release.apk`


##### Build an app bundle

From the command line:

1) Enter `cd [project]`
2) Run `flutter build appbundle`. (Running `flutter build` defaults to a release build.)

The release bundle for your app is created at `[project]/build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app.aab`.

By default, the app bundle contains your Dart code and the Flutter runtime compiled for armeabi-v7a (ARM 32-bit), arm64-v8a (ARM 64-bit), and x86-64 (x86 64-bit).


#### [iOS App](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios)

**Note**: For the complete guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of releasing a Flutter app to the App Store. For more details, see https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios.

In Xcode, configure the app version and build:

1) In Xcode, open `Runner.xcworkspace` in your app’s `ios` folder.
2) Select **Runner** in the Xcode project navigator, then select the **Runner** target in the settings view sidebar.
3) In the Identity section, update the **Version** to the user-facing version number you wish to publish.
4) In the Identity section, update the **Build** identifier to a unique build number used to track this build on [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/). Each upload requires a unique build number.

Finally, create a build archive and upload it to App Store Connect:

1) Run `flutter build ipa` to produce a build archive.
2) Open `build/ios/archive/MyApp.xcarchive` in Xcode.
3) Click the **Validate App** button. If any issues are reported, address them and produce another build. You can reuse the same build ID until you upload an archive.
4) After the archive has been successfully validated, click **Distribute App**. You can follow the status of your build in the Activities tab of your app’s details page on [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/).

#### [MacOS App](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/macos)

**Note**: For the complete guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of releasing a Flutter app to the App Store. For more details, see https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/macos.

In Xcode, configure the app version and build:

1) Open Runner.xcworkspace in your app’s macos folder. To do this from the command line, run the following command from the base directory of your application project.
```bash
open macos/Runner.xcworkspace
```
2) Select **Runner** in the Xcode project navigator, then select the **Runner** target in the settings view sidebar.
3) In the Identity section, update the **Version** to the user-facing version number you wish to publish.
4) In the Identity section, update the **Build** identifier to a unique build number used to track this build on [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/). Each upload requires a unique build number.

Finally, create a build archive and upload it to App Store Connect:

1) Create a release Archive of your application. From the base directory of your application project, run the following.
```bash
flutter build macos
```
2) Open Xcode and select **Product > Archive** to open the archive created in the previous step.
3) Click the **Validate App** button. If any issues are reported, address them and produce another build. You can reuse the same build ID until you upload an archive.
4) After the archive has been successfully validated, click **Distribute App**. You can follow the status of your build in the Activities tab of your app’s details page on [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/).

#### [Windows App](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64291336/how-to-build-release-version-of-windows-app)

**Note**: For the complete guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of build a Flutter app on windows or create file installer. For more details, see https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/linux.

You can use `flutter build windows` and it will do the build for you. Make sure to install **Desktop development with C++**.

The build `.exe` file can be found on `...\projectName\build\windows\runner\Release\`

You can use [msix](https://pub.dev/packages/msix) package for build. To build using `msix` you need to enable developer mode on Windows.

Type `start ms-settings:developers` and it will open the setting and enable it.

Open Command prompt (as Administrator if you needed) and navigate to your project directory and type these command

```bash
flutter build windows
flutter pub run msix:create
```

You will get an `.msix` app that will install the usual way windows does.

You can also [configuring your installer](https://pub.dev/packages/msix#github-settings-icon-configuring-your-installer).


For more details go to https://flutter.dev/desktop.

The executable can be found in your project under `build\windows\runner<build mode>`. In addition to that executable, you need the following:
**From the same directory:**
all the `.dll` files
the data directory

**The Visual C++ redistributable**
You can use any of the methods shown in the deployment example walkthroughs on the Microsoft site. If you use the application-local option, you need to copy:
`msvcp140.dll` `vcruntime140.dll` `vcruntime140_1.dll`
Place the DLL files in a directory next to the executable and the other DLLs, and bundle them together in a zip file.

#### [Linux App](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/linux)

**Note**: For the complete guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of releasing a Flutter app to [the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/store). For more details, see this forum https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64291336/how-to-build-release-version-of-windows-app.

##### Build the snap

Once the `snapcraft.yaml` file is complete, run `snapcraft` as follows from the root directory of the project.

To use the Multipass VM backend:

```bash
 snapcraft
```

To use the LXD container backend:

```bash
 snapcraft --use-lxd
```

##### Publish
Once the snap is built, you’ll have a `<name>.snap` file in your root project directory. You can now publish the snap. The process consists of the following:

1) Create a developer account at [snapcraft.io](https://snapcraft.io/), if you haven’t already done so.
2) Register the app’s name. Registration can be done either using the Snap Store Web UI portal, or from the command line, as follows:
```bash
 snapcraft login
 snapcraft register
```
3) Release the app. After reading the next section to learn about selecting a Snap Store channel, push the snap to the store:
```bash
 snapcraft upload --release=<channel> <file>.snap
```


#### [Web App](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/web)

**Note**: For the complete guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of releasing a Flutter app to the App Store. For more details, see https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/web.

During a typical development cycle, you test an app using `flutter run -d chrome` (for example) at the command line. This builds a debug version of your app.

Build the app for deployment using the `flutter build web` command. You can also choose which renderer to use by using the `--web-renderer` option (See [Web renderers](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/web-renderers)). 

This generates the app, including the assets, and places the files into the `/build/web` directory of the project.

The release build of a simple app has the following structure:

```bash
/build/web
  assets
    AssetManifest.json
    FontManifest.json
    NOTICES
    fonts
      MaterialIcons-Regular.ttf
      <other font files>
    <image files>
  index.html
  main.dart.js
  main.dart.js.map
```

Launch a web server (for example, `python -m http.server 8000`, or by using the [dhttpd](https://pub.dev/packages/dhttpd) package), and open the /build/web directory. Navigate to `localhost:8000` in your browser (given the python SimpleHTTPServer example) to view the release version of your app.

## Solving Errors

There are several potential errors when run or debug this music player app and you can find the some solutions how to fix it.

###  XMLHttpRequest (API Cors) Error in Flutter Web

It seems like `CORS error` is well-known issue in the web field. But it could be critical error. The error message is usually something like : 

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://itunes.apple.com' from origin 'http://localhost:59269' has been blocked by CORS policy: The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header has a value 'http://localhost:60893' that is not equal to the supplied origin.
```

You can check forum discusing at stackoverflow.com by clicking this link :
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65630743/how-to-solve-flutter-web-api-cors-error-only-with-dart-code/66879350

In order to make the process easier I highly recommend to use `flutter_cors` Dart Package.
Check this link : https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_cors

#### 1. Install `flutter_cors` Dart Package.

```bash
dart pub global activate flutter_cors
```

#### 2. Set Paths

```bash
export PATH="$PATH":"$HOME/.pub-cache/bin"
```

#### 3. Run `flutter_cors` for disable CORS

```bash
fluttercors --disable
```
